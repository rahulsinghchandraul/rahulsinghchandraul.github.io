I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute, Yale University](https://wti.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am also associated with the Brain Function Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine. My current research interests are in the areas of signal processing, graph neural networks, and machine learning applications in bioinformatics and neuroscience. I received my PhD in Machine Learning from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ml.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}. During my PhD I worked on various topics including Probabilistic Graphical Models, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Signal Processing. I got my Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from  [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I was also a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology where I worked with [Prof. B. S. Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj){:target="_blank"} on Complex Networks and Graph Signal Processing. Long ago, I received my B. Tech. degree from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India.
