I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute](https://wti.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Yale University. I am associated with [Brain Function Laboratory](http://fmri.org/){:target="_blank"} at Yale School of Medicine and [Krishnaswamy Lab](https://krishnaswamylab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the Yale Computer Science Department. My research lies at the crossroads of machine learning, signal processing, and computational neuroscience, with a focus on developing principled methods to analyze and model complex structured data. I am particularly motivated by problems where data inherently resides on irregular domains, exhibits intricate relationships, or necessitates robust and adaptive decision-making frameworks. My work spans four interconnected areas: graph signal processing and representation learning, probabilistic graphical models and optimal transport, distributional reinforcement learning, and applications in neuroscience.

I received my PhD in Machine Learning from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ml.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}. During my PhD, I worked on various topics including Probabilistic Graphical Models, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph Signal Processing. I got my Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from  [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology where I worked with [Prof. B. S. Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj){:target="_blank"} on Complex Networks and Graph Signal Processing. Long ago, I received my B. Tech. degree from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India.
