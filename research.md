### Research Focus & Interests

* **Next generation wireless networking infrastructures:**
    Concentrates on the provisioning of network resources by enhancing
    the network operating systems to accomodate existing and future
    communication requirements.

* **Wireless networking:** Software Defined Networks (SDN),
    Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTN), Wireless Mesh Networks
    (WMN), Sensor Networks, Satellite Networks, and Internet of Things
    (IoT).

* **Systems security:** I am interested in the security aspects of
    SDNs, especially from the perspective of SDN architecture.

* **Intelligent transportation systems:** Focus on the exploration of 
   hidden patterns in road networks to point out the possible reasons
   for the problems such as traffic congestion and inefficient traffic
   patterns.

* **Complex Networks:** I am interested in analyzing any system of social
    importance using the tools of complex network analysis.

### Research Projects Involved

1. **OPERA: An Open-Source Ecosystem for Broadband Prairie**: Provide
   leadership (in terms of organization, partnership, and
   infrastructure) in building open-source ecosystem in addition to
   contribute toward open source software, open source hardware, and
