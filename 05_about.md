I am a PhD student majoring in Machine Learning at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ml.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} working with [Prof. Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current research interests are in the areas of Probabilistic Graphical Models, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Signal Processing. I got my Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from  [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I was also a Research Associate at the Indian Institue of Space Science and Technology where I worked with [Prof. B. S. Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj){:target="_blank"} on Complex Networks and Graph Signal Processing. Long ago, I received my B. Tech. degree from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India.
