I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute, Yale University](https://wti.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am also associated with the Brain Function Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine. Recently I received a PhD in Machine Learning from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ml.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Prof. Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current research interests are in the areas of Probabilistic Graphical Models, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Signal Processing. I got my Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I was also a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology where I worked with [Prof. B. S. Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj){:target="_blank"} on Complex Networks and Graph Signal Processing. Long ago, I received my B. Tech. degree from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India. 

You can find more information about my research in my [CV](./rahul_cv.pdf).
